# DeepRacer

This is a summary of a few reward functions I tried out on the AWS DeepRacer model based on reinforcement learning.
The RF folder holds all the reward functions I have written along with the action space I have used. 
The Resources folder has the various exercises that the AWS DeepRacer course provides along with the resource pack for it.
These models are not the fastest, but did manage to complete 100% of the racetrack.
